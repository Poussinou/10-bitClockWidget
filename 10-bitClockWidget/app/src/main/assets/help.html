    10-bit Clock Widget uses 10 binary dots and their color, to represent current time in
    12-hour format. In the following image, first 4 dots (before separator line) represents
    hour (0-11), other 6 dots represent minutes (0-59) and color of these dots denotes
    A.M./P.M. as defined in widget settings. Furthermore, dim dots are 0s and bright dots are
    1s, so in following image, first 4 dots denote 1010 (10) and other 6 dots denote
    010011 (19).
